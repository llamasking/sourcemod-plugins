# Phaseout Notification

Used to notify players that the server they have joined is being phased out and provide the IP of a new server to join.

Also provides a `/hop` command to be reconnected to the new server, if desired.

Hop functionality is heavily based upon [this code](https://github.com/GAMMACASE/ServerRedirect/blob/master/addons/sourcemod/scripting/server_redirect/redirect.sp).

Intended exclusively for my own purposes. This means I only need it to function on TF2 for as long as I am using it.
