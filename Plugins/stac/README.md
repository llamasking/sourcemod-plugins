# Steph's Anti-Cheat

A modified verson of [StAC](https://github.com/sapphonie/StAC-tf2) with a portion of the FOV detection removed. This is due to a false positive that can occur on the "Funny Feeling" RTD.

This probably should be hooked into the RTD plugin itself so that the detection is only disabled on clients who are actively under the effect, but I'm too lazy for that.
