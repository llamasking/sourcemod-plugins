# Steph's Anti-Cheat

**The latest version of StAC appears to have removed fullbright detections. As such, this plugin is no longer of any use.**

A modified verson of [StAC](https://github.com/sapphonie/StAC-tf2) that does not contain any fullbright detections.

This is due to the fact that [certain workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2281588836) maps cause fullbright detection to falsely trigger.
