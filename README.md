# Sourcemod Plugins

A repo with the source for all my SourceMod plugins. To be honest, this is pretty much just for organization.

-   Auto Hostname: A plugin I specifically made for my servers that automatically changes the hostname based on the map the server is currently on.
-   Custom Votes: [This](https://github.com/sneak-it/cvreduxmodified) custom votes plugin but without the map ending check because I was running into issues with that.
-   Exec On Empty ([AlliedMods](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=325949)): A very simple plugin that executes a specified config whenever everyone on a server leaves.
-   Little Anti-Cheat - Auto SourceTV Recorder ([AlliedMods](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2709181&postcount=8)): Not my plugin, but I added a convar so that you can specify what directory the demos should go in.
-   Player Analytics - A fork of [sneak-it](https://github.com/sneak-it/PlayerAnalytics)'s fork of [Dr. McKay](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=230832)'s plugin. Yeah, there are quite a few levels to this one. I added support to check for premium TF2 as well as removing the need for GeoIPCity in favor of GeoIP2.
-   SqlVIP - An unfinished plugin I created to read a list of Steam2 IDs off a MySQL database and add them to a VIP admin group. I abandoned this after I realized SM has sqladmins already. I may finish it at some point for fun.
