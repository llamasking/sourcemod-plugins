# Sourcemod Plugins

A repo with the source for all my SourceMod plugins. To be honest, this is pretty much just for organization.

## Updater

Due to a restructuring of this repo, updater for Workshop Vote v1.0.5 and Private Analytics v0.2.2 and below no longer functions.

If you want to update (or just remove the error message), you must do so manually.
